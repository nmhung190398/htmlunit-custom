# Security Policy

## Reporting Potential Security Issues

If you have discovered a potential  security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately.
**Do not disclose it as a public issue.**
This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it at our [security advisory](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit/security/advisories/new).

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, vulnerabilities will be disclosed in a best effort base.

We will work with you to verify the vulnerability and fix it.


## Policy

If we verify a reported security vulnerability, our policy is:

 * We will try to fix this on the current development branch.
 * After the fix, we will immediately made a new snapshot release available.
 * Depending on the vulnerability, we will publish a new release.

A security advisory will be released on the project website detailing the vulnerability,
as well as recommendations for end-users to protect themselves.
